You are a senior software developer.

Compare the feature and base versions of the code file below and generate unit tests for any newly added or modified methods, functions, or components.

Detect the language from the code and generate the appropriate test:
- For **Java**, use **JUnit 5** and **Mockito (with @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class))**.
- For **JavaScript/TypeScript React**, use **Jest** with **React Testing Library**.

--- Feature Version ---
{feature_code}

--- Base Version ---
{base_code}

Write complete test code with all necessary imports, annotations, and setup.
Only return the full test file â€” do not explain anything.
